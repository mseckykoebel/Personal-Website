_The last picture I took of Harvey_

On April 15th, I lost my best friend. He would have been 6 in May.‚Äç

My grandma named him. His first name was Gus, but Harvey seemed right. He was named after the movie Harvey with James Stewart; Harvey was an 8-foot tall invisible rabbit, who served as the companion to Stewart's character - the only one that could see and interact with him.‚Äç

Harvey came into my life when I was at my lowest. I was falling out of school, I was 65 lbs heavier, and I was unsure of who I was and what my passions were. Right away, in a lot of ways, I could relate to him. I fell in love primarily because he reminded me of myself.

I grew to view him as unique; as living art.

Because he didn't move a lot, I found it easier to appreciate more of who he was, both physically and concerning his quirks. I fell in love with the noises he would make, the way he walked, smelled, ate, how he ran, and especially how he slept.

He blended into the environment. No other object, or especially no other dog, made me want to sit back and enjoy the moment more - to have the urge to capture the moment on camera with so little going on. It could be 2:30 pm on a summer afternoon, or late at night in the winter, and he would find a way to make the environment perfect. Like there wasn't a care in the world.

What was the biggest lesson he taught me? That you come first. He was the kind of dog to cry if you didn't have your hand on him when he wanted to lay with you. To an onlooker, he was incredibly selfish and didn't have a lot of utility outside being a lap dog, barking at night, and sleeping downstairs.

But for me, he taught me that I come first. If I am enough for me, I can then be content with what I bring to the table, and be confident that I can help others after I have first tended to myself.

What makes me most sad is that I will say his name less.

A few days after his passing and I would say his name into the emptiness of my room, the same way I would say it if he was in the room with me. In a sense, it has always felt like he was there with me, as I would not have to do a lot to convince myself that he was near. It was hard to tell the difference. If someone had been watching me, they would have surely thought I'd had lost it.

Now that he is gone, it is going to take a long time for it to completely feel real.

I am a believer in the Zen Buddhist concept of "continuation." We are never born, and therefore we never die. One's brain is a discrimination machine; to give more value to something that breathes and has a consciousness does not necessarily make a lot of sense if you "zoom out."  A spec of dust has the same amount of information as the most intelligent and capable person. The particles that make up that spec of dust could have had more of a complex and lively history that the particles that make up that intelligent person. A rose and a dandelion to mother nature are the same; to us, they are viewed as positive and negative things.

Yet I have found that it is not always helpful to think this way. Feeling sadness and remorse is incredibly normal. I suppose then, in this respect, I have a choice. And, I want to view him as someone that is always going to be with me, purely because I can make it that way, not because it is the way the world works.

And, there is some comfort in feeling that one day when I do die or am close to it, I can look back and enjoy him one last time, through photos, videos, or some mental simulation of what he would do if he was with me at this moment.

There is virtue in the thought of a place like heaven. I like the thought that after I die, he is there to greet me, looking through some glass window and wagging his tail, just as he did when he saw me come home from school after many months, and just as he did after we came back to pick him up after getting him when he was a puppy.

I know that in 20, 30+ years, I'll be sitting at my desk, or playing with my kids, and think of him sitting on the couch watching my family grow up, or sleeping on the grass with the sun beaming down.

I'm glad that's an option.
