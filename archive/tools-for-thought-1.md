"Creativity is just connecting things."‚Äç

Tools for thought is a term most attributed to Kenneth Iverson - they are technology tools that expand what people are capable of doing. Most notably, tools for thought also expand how people are capable of thinking. A medium for which where new ideas are not only possible but even likely.‚Äç

One of my favorite summaries on the importance of developing tools for thought comes from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's piece on tools for thought. To understand the importance of developing, and examples of tools for thought, I recommend you give it a read.‚Äç

Here, I want to talk about some barriers to developing tools for thought concerning formal education. The effects that these tools have, and their difficulty in adoption is based on research I have done concerning learning environments, neuroplasticity, and epistemology.

### Automation in education

Most of my favorite tools for thought have been in the creative space: Adobe, Figma, and Webflow to name a few. I cannot say the same about software tools concerning learning, both online and in the formal classroom.

Modern learning is dominated by marketing. Just like a tacky workout program being advertised on Instagram, you probably won't want to participate if it takes too long, or you do not rapidly transform your body doing it. Why would I buy x's program if it takes 2x as long, and I see .5x the results, of y's program?

The problem is this: the brain is shaped by repetition, whether it be in learning, or conditioning your body. Modern tools for thought, specifically in education, should make taking the easy hard route to learn as easy and as exciting as possible. Online content forums, Facebook groups, and adaptive learning shove so much automation and enticing media into the learning process that it makes a deep understanding of a concept (mastery of something taking 10,000 hours, according) unintuitive.

And that is scary. To grow up thinking that your environment, experiences, and stimuli can be automated is akin to taking away part of what it means to be human. To automate sensing things on your own, and to uniquely go out and experience things, for me, is very dangerous.

It's almost like those that are less exposed to internet-heavy applications have a higher chance of both deep learning and creative expression.

Add economic inequity on top of this, and it is safe to say that tools for thought and education are at odds.

### What can be done

What would tools for thought in education look like?

I propose this simple answer: find a balance between the path of most resistance, and motivation.

The brain is not just shaped by repetition, it is shaped by new and difficult experiences. It is shaped by confrontation and actual IRL actions. Whether you like it or not, what you do and do not do repeatedly shapes who you are.

One of my key issues with software that automates the learning experience is that it puts a wall on what is possible. There is no room for discovery and no room for connecting things that may not have been connected. When a group of people in silicon valley are designing your curriculum, they are bound to miss something. And, when they are designing a curriculum that is 'one size fits all,' there are always going to be outliers. Instead of building a shanty silver bullet solution, why not design the best tools for the best environment? Or, better yet, one that is not dependent on the environment.

Or, better better yet, stop designing curriculums all together. Seriously. It's not working. We have the internet now.

If education is going to be transformed, and tools for thought are going to find their way into classrooms and online learning environments, education needs to be gamified in just the right way where there is room for motivation for both struggle and creativity. Where rewards are not based on grades, but instead, consistency. Where engineering and mathematics are on the same playing field and are just as valuable as studying languages, theatre, art, or music.

After all, in 10 years, STEM is going to be so automated by computation that the true value of the liberal arts is going to be made brutally clear. 10 years after that, we'll hopefully all be working on art and music as automation fills in more and more of the pesky gaps that we try so hard to fill now with 'productivity hacks.'

Human intuition is going to take a long time to reliably automate. And if/when we get to that point, I think we'll ask why we even bothered in the first place.

STEM topics are easier to grade, as there is more emphasis on right and wrong answers. Seeing patterns in a STEM-like process can be graded easier than an essay, or a piece of music, or a performance. All of the latter subjects are more subjective, and are harder to quantify. Grading is going to/should disappear, and new forms of gamification are going to be needed.
