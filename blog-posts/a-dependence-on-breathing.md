I get...meta...really easily - I think a *lot*, to the point where if left unchecked I lose a lot of time in the day. This was especially an issue when I was a kid and would spend hours of the day walking aimlessly around my house.

I think one of the reasons meditation has been so appealing to me is that it allows me to "containerize" my thoughts so that I can more effectively *do* things. If I'm thinking about 20 things, after meditating it becomes 0. Some time after that it becomes 2 or 3, but it never really gets back up to 20 in the day.

Hence the paradox: before I can do a lot, I must first genuinely force myself to do nothing.

This kind of focus has, in a lof of ways, helped me mature and prioritize things. On the other hand, it has also set me back. On some days, when I don't take those ten minutes to center myself, I sometimes have a hard time talking, and...listening well. It has led to a sort of pseudo-dependence on meditation.

While the past three years has seen my focus, and attention to detail, improve due to taking those 10 minutes, I hope the next few are filled with learning about other ways to do the same thing.
