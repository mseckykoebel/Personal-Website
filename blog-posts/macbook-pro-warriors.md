_Pre-order now._

I recently changed my major from computer engineering to computer science, intending to turn that into a custom artificial intelligence major.

The short reason - I didn't like it; as soon as I got into hardware design, I felt like I was being asked to write the same sentence over and over again. And, at the same time, I wasn't able to think up any problems I could solve, or projects I could directly apply myself too.

Still, I was quite reluctant to switch into computer science - not because I did not like it (strange thing is I HATE coding, but I love CS), but because I didn't like the aura.

I didn't like being around MacBook pro warriors.

### What's a MacBook Pro Warrior?

I made up the term MacBook Pro Warrior a few years ago to symbolize the kinds of people who get into computer science primarily for the perceived lifestyle, instead of an inherent interest in algorithms, optimization, design, and/or problem-solving/applicability that the discipline has.

A MacBook Pro Warrior (MPW) does not describe anyone's physical appearance or some sort of natural intelligence level (you can be really smart and still be a MPW). In short, a MPW puts the pedigree of a company in front of the values that the company has, and the problems that they want to solve.

### What makes someone a MPW?

Typically, MPW's are very interested in padding their resume with as many internships and projects as possible, but upon inspection lacks topical cohesion. If someone has an exciting resume full of CS-related experiences, but all of the experiences are generally unrelated to one another, they might be a MPW.‍

A MPW may also not be good at programming. And, no, I do not mean speed and the talent to memorize a table of methods and API's. I mean come up with unique solutions to problems, and iterating on them to make them faster, more secure, and suitable in more situations where edge cases exist. If someone has to lean on other people's code or have to consistently try and cut corners to try and get the job done, they might be a MPW.‍

And finally, a MPW may be in CS just for the money. CS-related skills and jobs are in high demand and continue to climb in necessity due to the omnipresence of computers. This means someone can get a CS degree and be valued just about anywhere; many still look at the Facebooks, Amazons, Googles, and Microsofts of the world.‍

With all due respect, who wants to work at Facebook? What are they working on that is actually interesting/innovative?‍

So, if someone is looking only at the big guys, and not considering places where they may be valued more, make more of an impact (which, ahem, involves being at your job for more than a couple of years), and learn more, they might be a MPW. 

### Values over a paycheck

During my first year at Northwestern, I was caught in the riptide of MPW culture, and the anxiety that comes with applying for internships. It wasn't until I didn't get one at all that I realized how silly all of it was. I applied for 100 internships, and at least 70 of them I had no real core interest in. What's up with that?

In hindsight, it was crazy and wasn't a good use of my time. It was a lot of unnecessary stress, all for what seemed like clout points. It was what everyone else was doing, so I did it too. Not comparing yourself to others is one of the golden things you need to learn how to do in college, and for me, this was my wakeup call.

Overall there is nothing wrong with being a MPW. Nevertheless, I believe that what doesn't make you a MPW is loving what you do, the problems you solve, and those you are working with. Being young is the time to fuck up and try new things. There is no use in doing things that do not make you happy, even though they may not seem right, or do not have a bean bag room as one of its listed benefits.

Even though big tech companies seem alluring (and to some, the right thing to do), working for a company whose core values deeply align with yours, at the end of the day, matters much more than pedigree. It is the difference between being on the road to true fulfillment, and being drowned out by the consistent noise generated by all those around you - do not let them in your ear. Or, if no company seems to align with your core values, starting a company is also a viable option (just saying).

### Epilogue - why I had a hard time switching

To be honest, it was because I did not want to share a major with so many people who seemed ingenuine.

I suppose I still have some individuating to do. I enjoy the classes I am taking, as I have progressed enough to take classes in the things I enjoy.

At the end of the day, a lot of school is a means to an end, and a degree is a degree. It is what you do that matters more.
