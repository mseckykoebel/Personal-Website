_Somewhere in Pennsylvania_

I talked to my older cousin last night for the first time in 4 years. Among the topics we discussed was networking. He reminisced about what it was like to be 21 again (he‚Äôs 41 now). He finished school later than usual and immediately went into real-estate after his athletic career ended prematurely.

‚ÄúSecky‚Äôs don‚Äôt work for anyone else‚Ä¶but you gotta play the game.‚Äù

I hate networking. I hate LinkedIn. And, yes, I hate playing the game. It always felt disingenuous. I always clung too hard to childhood giftedness and a sense that I could ride meritocracy like an elevator to the kingdom of a 6-figure check. Or my own business, with Tech Crunch spreads, space lasers, and strippers.

But, I went to Northwestern - and that‚Äôs not what I got.

At one stage when I was 19, I applied for as many positions as I could, and talked to a bunch of random people I didn‚Äôt know, to make something happen. In the end, I chose to do research on the things I found interesting. Yet, I thought, how far could this *really* go?

But, that time for me is changing. Maybe it‚Äôs the pandemic, but I kinda want to learn to play the game. I‚Äôve been entrepreneurial for a couple of years now - maybe to avoid playing it. Executive function boils down to not being able to handle the basic shit in life, like taking out the garbage and going to buy food.

*Buuuut* I really don‚Äôt want to do that from my childhood bedroom in a couple of years. That time in life has passed.

If you‚Äôre reading this and can relate, I would recommend you learn how to live like everyone else *juuuust* enough so that you can do the things you really want to do later on. I think I‚Äôm pretty good at games, so maybe I could learn to get good at this one.
