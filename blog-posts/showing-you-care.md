_My mom and I, back when I had better style._

When I was very young, my mom would ask me to verbally tell her that I loved her, saying that I didn't do it enough. She also asked me if I could hug her at times without her having to ask me.
‚Äç
"You already know that I love you" was the standard response I gave. She would then tell me, "I know, but sometimes I need you to tell me. Sometimes mommy needs to hear it."

### Making your interest known - implied vs applied care.

As an adult, and as someone who has had experience with negative feelings associated with feeling alone, the importance of making implied support known, whether it be to someone you've known all your life, one of your long-term co-workers, maybe even someone that you like that you've only known for a few weeks, is an exercise that I believe has to be practiced by more people.‚Äç

One of the ways that people come together is with shared experiences. Commonly, these experiences stem from environmental means that are not driven by anyone intending to bring comradery. Instead, more generally, people are brought together by shared passions and experiences: music, theatre, technology, an outlook on life, or a sudden change in tone, such as the passing of a loved one.

Like my mom was trying to teach me, these implied "strings" that hold people together are not enough for deep fulfillment, even among loved ones. For example, you can have friends for years before realizing the superficial nature of your relationship when the relationship is tested.

So what would this "exercise" look like? Well, it's actually pretty straightforward:

"I hear your father is in the hospital, I hope he is doing alright." "Yeah, we had a bit of a scare last night, but he's doing a lot better now, thank you for asking."

"Hey! How are you enjoying your new job?"

... Now dialing (845) 555-6712 ...

And so on.

The power of showing that you care, even when you know you already do, matters much more to the receiver of the message than it might initially mean to you. And, with some practice, it can become a regular occurrence.

For me, in the beginning, I would send or call those I cared about as a way to keep myself occupied. Nowadays, I do it in part because I know it brings us closer together. Breaking up the monotony of implied care, and turning it into more applied care, is how relationships change. Most of the time, for the better.

Measuring victories in the day - a word from Benjamin Franklin's daily planner.
Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule looked like this:

_Circa 2010._

He began and ended the day with two very mindful questions: "What good shall I do this day?" and "What good have I done today?"‚Äç

Many of us spend our days working, prioritizing, and in a consistent battle with a to-do list. There sometimes come days where you feel like you haven't accomplished anything, due to a lack of things crossed off this list (whose levels of value you, to an extent, assigned an arbitrary level of importance).‚Äç

It sucks. But, there are other ways to gauge daily success.

Helping people with work that they have, answering a question for someone, smiling at someone, calling your parents, answering a question online, and messaging an old friend all qualify as successful daily outputs. But, they are hardly present on people's to-do lists, or a part of someone's daily workflow. All of these methods are mindful practices of active intention, and all can benefit the facilitated perhaps more than the facilitator.

For me, I know by performing a practice such as this, I know that I am building trust, and succeeding in bringing the receiver a sense of value. If they're not expecting it, that makes it even better.

So like my mom taught me, those that are most important to you could need a little reminding, even if it doesn't seem like they would. And for anyone else you either care about a lot or just appreciate what they bring to the table, the same reminders and/or actions could mean just as much.
