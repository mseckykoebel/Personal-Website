_Macy's clearance._

Don't ever think you've got it figured out. That is a sentiment I try to remind myself as much as I can.‍

I have found that in life, motivation and willpower simply aren't enough to accomplish something you want to accomplish to a gratifying degree. Life is hard, and obtaining some motivational impulse whenever you need to get something important done is pretty unrealistic. There needs to be some sort of affinity for the unknown. The uncomfortable. The process.

For me, as well as the rest of us, the dream is to wake up feeling excited about the uncertainty, and the unknown pleasures the day can bring. Then, in the end, reflect and be ready to do it all over again.‍

To help me do this, I try and do by two distinct sets of values: daily values, and "north star" values. This mindset applies to Lighthouse, as well as my relationships with friends and family.

### My Daily Values

I have touched on spiritualism for the last year and a half (stories here to follow); one of the benefits of taking some time each day to be mindful is the feeling that each day is, in a lot of ways, independent of the days prior.

The collection of values that help me begin the day like it is a brand new fall into my set of daily values. Substantive values include a nice cup of coffee, a book, the birds chirping, or even the outfit I am wearing for the day. All of these things, at one point, I appreciated enough in one moment to bring closer to me. They are pleasures that have been habituated; mindfully reminding myself why they are there is a fantastic exercise.

Daily values are also tied to people and relationships. Reminding oneself of the great people in your life, whether it is family, friends, co-workers, or a partner, can be motivating, or at least assuring, of the day ahead.

In a lot of ways, I can be satisfied with these types of joys. North star values go one step forward.

### My North Star Value(s)

North star values, for me, go much further than short-term goals or affinities of the world. They represent a core concern that you have had for other people, and/or your environment, for almost all of your life. These are the values that ultimately give your life deep meaning.‍

I say value(s) as there can be more than one, but one is enough.‍

These types of values do not focus on the day to day goals or metrics. These are subject to more rapid change and can change in an instant due to some change in the environment. Rather, when goals, however arbitrary in origin they may seem, are checked off, the feeling is that one is closer to achieving the ultimate goals set forth by your north star values.‍

North star values are problems or just causes that you, or your organization, will not be able to solve in your lifetime: world hunger, eradication of suffering for a large group of people, climate change, or anything else that alleviates pain on a massive scale. These fundamental values are molded by time and hardened through experience. They, in a large part, decide who you will work for, and who you will extend yourself to (person or organization).‍

Lighthouse has one core vision: we want to live in a world where the environment one is born into does not hinder one's access to learning.‍

That's it.

Lighthouse's one primary mission touches on income inequality, and shrinking the opportunity gap.
The core reason I started Lighthouse is the fact that no other company, or organization, was taking this cause seriously enough. Nearly one year later, and I am more sure of this life path than ever before.

Lighthouse, and by extension myself, and all those that join me in this cause, will not succeed in this vision. But it is a vision I will spend each day trying to get closer too. It is a vision I will sacrifice some of life's pleasures to try to further. It is a vision I will die striving to accomplish.

Daily values are a mindful affection of the relative. North star values are a mindful affection of the ultimate.
