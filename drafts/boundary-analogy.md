### The vision

We are not ready for AI.

From our policies, to our schools - from the way we work to the way that we eat - we are not ready for AI. 

In general, I describe the next 100 or so years like this:

Humans are toolmakers - we always have been. We are pretty lousy on our own (insert that Steve Jobs video where he talks about the condor and the person on a bicycle). It is only when we build things to use that we are at our best. And, so far, we have managed to do this in ways that nature could never have done on its own. 

5,500 years ago we invented the wheel, to accomplish tasks and move things across earth. One would agree that land-based vehicles today are much more capable at traveling the earth, relative to our wants and needs, when compared to things in nature. Actually, **nature isn't even close.**

The same goes for air travel. A little over 100 years ago, we took modern flight. Today, we have rockets, and renewed supersonic jets. Again, **nature. isn't. even. close.**

So...what about thinking? What about intelligence? What about recognizing patterns? It is 

And, I believe, contrary to a [few notable names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGYbbLWn-IE), that this is going to happen within the next 100 years. AI will be able to do the things that we can do - even the creative stuff. We don't have to replicate the intricacies of muscles of gazelles and eagles when we needed to move fast or fly, right?

This is because we make tools that are **useful to us**, and we measure that usefulness with metrics. If you look at the landscape of AI in that lense, general AI **might** not be useful, so
  
### An analogy

I'm a vegetarian, so I like this analogy.

As mentioned [here](https://masonseckykoebel.vercel.app/posts/boundary-how-did-we-get-here), the problem with creating a more information-rich internet in a major way boils down to _behavior change_.

### Boundary's programs

- A newsletter that makes AI and advanced technology easy to understand
- The best AI community in the world, driven by constant and consistent feedback
- A great technical, but well-designed website, one prioritizes great design, copy, and information organization.
- A great set of modern partnerships, with technical and non-technical organizations doing great technical and social work
- A great set of presenters
- A great set of projects, and technical walk-throughs
- Great marketing

That's it. For each, there will be a program manager, and a set of members doing tasks. It will be as horizontal as possible, and structured from the bottom-up.

### The bottom line

Computers, one day, will be able to out-think us. In narrow spaces today, they already can. They can play games better than us, make art faster than us, and
