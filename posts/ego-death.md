_The abandoned golf course._

This last week was one of the hardest I've experienced since I'd been alive (or 'continued' for the spiritually aware).

The image of death, self-harm, and harm to others are sensations I am no stranger to. This time around, there were some differences - some things that rightfully had me concerned.

I am still here, and I'll always know that's where I want to be. I am thankful for those around me for helping lead me when I was not able to lead myself. This has been true in the past, and it continues to be true today.

### Shrooms

I tried shrooms (my first psychedelic) with a group of friends during spring break of 2019. We tripped on an abandoned golf course in the eighty-five-degree heat, trying to play cards between bouts of laughter, fatigue, laying on the cement, and gazing up at the green and brown hills. It was amazing, and a lot of fun.‍

A few hours later it was nighttime, and we were on the outside patio of my friend's house. A friend of a friend visited and brought his bong, and we were getting ready to rotate. The shrooms had yet to wear off and a few of us were still giggling in our seats. When the bong got to me, I was pretty careless and took a hit that nearly knocked me on the ground.‍

I ran coughing into the kitchen to grab a glass of water. Leaning over the island, a friend came in to check on me. I told him I was fine and just needed to catch my breath. Another friend came in shortly after to check on me, and I said the same thing, still leaning on the island. After some time, I looked at the digital clock on the oven, and I soon became fearful when I saw that twenty minutes had passed in what seemed like two.‍

I started shuffling towards my room, which was down a flight of stairs and across a long hallway. As I approached the top of the stairs, I completely lost the capacity to tell time. That was rapidly followed by my hearing, all sensation in my feet and hands, and 90% of my sight. I felt like I was sinking into a dark void, with a small window connecting me to reality. I could barely make out the path to my room, but I had enough sight to make out a morphed outline of a bed.‍

"I'm not in bed right now." "I am in the back of an ambulance." "Oh god, I hit my head and my friends are taking care of me."

I was severely hallucinating; all I could hear was my own inner voice, and all I could see were violent surges of darkness.‍

"I must be ok."‍

I asked myself a series of questions, as I began to get an idea of where I was and what was happening. It felt like I was in a million pieces, and the small shards I possessed of myself were enough to look about and try to rationalize what was going on.‍

"I must be ok. I have to be in my bed right now. How did I get to my bed? I must be good. I have to be good if I made it this far. I have to be good and loved."‍

During this dark, dreamy, panic-state, I looked to my left and made out a window. I recognized it as my room window at night - I could see the trees moving as the wind blew them against the side of the house.‍

I also knew where I was. I was six years old again, wrapped up in my bedsheets, hypnotized by what seems to be a rather basic, ordinary occurrence. I was re-living a previous memory I had when I had no idea really who I was. And, it was beautiful.‍

I started to cry. It was cathartic.‍

I quickly morphed into a small golden ball, whizzing around what looked like a sea of colors. I would now describe the sensations as exactly what 60's posters of someone tripping would look like. "Wow, they were right." "Holy shit it does look like this."‍

And this is where terror turned to awe and wonder.‍

For two hours I was able to submerge myself into different sections of my mind: pleasure, adventures, good people. They were vivid, eclectic lucid dreams. They were as good as real. Anything I wanted I could have. And, they were all pleasurable. No discomfort, and no pain. Just fantasia.‍

At times I would come to - each time I did I would stick my head out of the pillow I was laying on, and my vision would be 10% clearer. I would slowly look at my phone, down at my legs, and up at the ceiling.‍

After a few moments, I decided, "alright, back to it." I crossed the border and went back to my greatest ever adventure.

### The little man

I reflect on that experience's greatest lesson to me as the "little man." In my biggest moment of uncertainty - the scariest thing to have happened to me up until that point, I was able to find stability. I was able to find my way home. From two or three fragments of familiarity, I was able to build myself up again.

I call it the little man after that experience with the golden ball. I was briefly in a turbulent sea, without any way to control my direction or orientation. But I didn't capsize. I didn't fall into the water. I stayed afloat.

When I am having my hardest days I think of that moment. It brought an internal intuition to me that holds me and comforts me. It has told me that no matter how challenging things get, or how unfamiliar things are, I'll never, ever, sink. I won't be defeated. I'll find my way home.

In some ways, some parts of me are six again, laying in bed, looking up at the night sky. Others are riding the bus on their way to school on a rainy Tuesday morning, head pressed up against the glass. Comfort...stillness...is always with you. Home is always with you. And you can always find it.

Epilogue
If there was one part of my life I would give up everything to have exist on film, it would be my walk from the kitchen to my bed. I genuinely do not know how I made it without falling over. I had no memory of it at all.

After that experience, obviously, I was fascinated. It forever changed my view of the brain and its capability to bring back memories.

Among other things, the biggest conclusion I drew was this - given the right retrieval cues, any partially-spatial memory can be recalled. Every second of every day, providing it was partially conscious, can be brought back to consciousness.

A lot of aspects of Lighthouse are based on this moment in my life. I am convinced that technology that fully takes advantage of spatial memory, whether it be through interface design, or context cues has yet to be created.

I want Lighthouse to be the first.
