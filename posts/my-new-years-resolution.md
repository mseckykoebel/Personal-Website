Already 17 days late, but better late than never.

I never saw myself as a writer until recently. I have, however, to some extent, always seen myself as a creator. Now, that notion hasn't always carried over into what I do in my free time, but it has recently begun to pour into my main passion - Lighthouse.

As a simple practice in consistency, I made this website, back in September. I made it as a sort of public scratchpad - a place where my voice could mature, in front of an audience (if anyone would be so kind). I also saw it as a place where I could document some important stops on my journey through growing Lighthouse, as well as a place to put more cohesive thoughts that may not be related to education, technology, or anything else I typically revolve around.

I suppose that is me in a nutshell...partly unpredictable, but at least trying to be consistent about it.

So in this new year, I am making a promise to myself to publish something new here at least every two weeks. This goal of mine serves as a practice to break apart my equal parts perfectionism and procrastination - "I can wait until the last minute to do something and it still will be something I will be proud sharing." For me, that has never been the case. With this, I am not giving myself an out.

I enjoy new years resolutions - in 2015 I made a resolution to lose 60 pounds, and I did. In 2017 it was to get into a good university, and I did. And, in 2019, I resolve to produce more, and to judge myself less.

And, to whomever stops, by, thank you. We're in this together, after all.

Many, many smiles,

M
