So, writing a lot is hard.

I am working on a plan to write more.

This summer, I will be trying to document two things:

- The building of Marion
- Some essays on the future of education

Marion is Lighthouse's first tool: a tool where connections between what you write and create are automatically generated.

My essays are more like scattered blog posts that I've been writing for the last few months. I think they need a few more months before I find a rhythm and post them online. I am also figuring out how I can do it in video form.

I feel like consuming the same content in video format will be 10x more engaging. At the same time, I think I will enjoy working on it myself.

I will release some as teasers before the start of September, and eventually, school.

### Lighthouse

Identifying "problems" with modern learning is hard.
‍
We've all experienced some form of academic or growth-related hardships. If someone has a problem, someone else has likely gone through a similar experience. So, some would say finding problems with modern learning is really easy.‍

Yet, problems vary widely based on location, with factors such as economic/cultural/intellectual diversity, available professional services and resources, and technical abilities all being potential pitfalls to someone getting the most out of some learning resource or institution. A lot of these problems are also concentrated on schools, namely k-12 and higher education. If asked about a personal problem with education, most people would point to some deficiencies in schools.

For that reason, solutions to learning have grown to match these systems: higher grades, saved teacher time, advanced teaching analytics, and access to higher quantities of learning resources.
‍
This is an issue, chiefly because there is a difference between learning and education. Education is classroom learning with standards and a curriculum. Learning is the pursuit of knowledge based on personal and/or shared experiences. One is a human right and is reasonably well defined. One is a human construct and has morphed our view on what it means to learn.

So, Lighthouse is a learning company, and not an education technology company. The products we design are towards the pursuit of learning, and not strictly confined to education/educational institutions.
‍
So, in short, we define our "problems" to be the following:

- Learners aspire to make meaningful, original connections independently, and frequently.
- Learners aspire to solve problems collaboratively, and to a degree of high satisfaction.
- Learners aspire to understand learning as a lifelong journey.
