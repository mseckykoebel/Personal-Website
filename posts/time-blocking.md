*The beagle and I*

Well, I've begun my resolution with a topic that is indisputably going to get the crowd off their feet - time blocking!

For those uninformed, time blocking is an organization strategy where one blocks out periods of their day to work on one particular thing. And man did I used to fear it. I mean just look:

When I got to Northwestern, and my schedule shifted from petting dogs and sleeping in, to doing mountains of work, my organizational deficiencies became very obvious. So, when I initially searched for ways to manage my time, time blocking was a common trend among the suggestions.

And, frankly, I wasn't buying it. It looked like all it would do was constrain me, and not allow for any flexibility within my day.

But last week, I finally gave it a try. After one week, I can say I have officially been converted.

I can also say with a high degree of confidence that its benefits are described much better than it's implementation. That is pretty much what this post is for. So, let me explain how I use time blocking to get shit done, but also allow for plenty of flexibility.

### If you block time for one thing, you don't have to just work on that one thing

This was a nice realization. When I block out an hour to study for a class, send some important emails, or eat, it doesn't mean that I just do that one thing. The distribution ends up looking a lot more like this:

I make the dedicated task the main focus of the time block, not the only thing I work on. If I need to take a phone call, answer an email, go get some water, or go pick up a friend because their car broke down, I absolutely can. I just try to do the most important thing the most.

This alone is not enough for this to not feel constrained, however. What about if something unexpected comes up? This leads to my second strategy.

### Repetition, and forgiveness

If you are a student, it is not advantageous to study for an exam for 5+ hours the day before (eh, guilty as charged). It is literally better if you study for an hour a day, five days before the exam. The same kind of rationale can be used in time blocking.‍

If I have an assignment that is due in a week, I try and block out 30-60 minutes for the assignment a day, every day, until it is due. This is not only a better way to complete the work (maintained repetition is how the brain learns), but it allows for my life to get in the way. It allows me to call my mom, or go out to lunch on a whim. I know that I can tell myself, "Hey, I can do this tomorrow." Because I know I have time.‍

And, if the deadline is getting closer and I am behind, I just make the blocks progressively larger as the deadline nears.‍

So, yeah, it looks ugly. But I have tried a lot of things to get things done, and unbeknownst to me, I saved the best for last.‍

P.S. - I PROMISE next week won't be as boring. Baby steps. Thanks for reading this far!
