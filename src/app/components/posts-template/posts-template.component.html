      introduction: some assumptions 
    </div> 
    <p class="paragraph">I am not going to spend a lot of time in this report discussing the specific technology behind adaptive learning, or much in the way of the definition of the term itself. Definitions such as this one offered by McGraw Hill, and this one offered by SmartSparrow, are concise and clear enough to get an understanding, although it should be known that these two sources are involved in the selling, and distribution of these programs, so their definitions will be sure to highlight their benefits, as well as all of the complex work that goes into their design. </p> 
    <p class="paragraph">Furthermore, the scope of this report does not cover the technology that powers these platforms, nor the theory they are based on. This report speaks about the deficiencies and the flaws of adaptive learning within the context of the classroom; this includes e-learning "platforms" designed to be integrated into the classroom as a learning supplement, and/or some sort of proficiency determinant to some capacity. I give examples of research, publications, and stories that counter a lot of the positive press these sorts of programs garner, and why claimed technology advancements in offered to a classroom, or even to a household, should always be taken with a grain of salt. It is important to remember that those of whom that are writing about, or raving about adaptive learning programs, are usually the people trying to sell them, or are involved in the research showing their efficacy</p> 
    <p class="paragraph">I do not pose solutions to the issues I discuss, but instead address what software, or human intervention, would need to do to solve the deficiencies I raise. At the end of this report, I explain how I believe adaptive learning, and artificial intelligence (the technology that powers it), can be useful and should be used in the sphere of education, and the realm of the acquisition of knowledge as a fundamental human right.</p>
